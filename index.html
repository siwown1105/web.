<p><h3>What is coding? While we have defined coding<br> as the act of writing
  a script in a language that your computer can understand,<br> letâ€™s get down and dirty and have a look at some coding background.<br>
Computers don't understand human language and in order for us to see<br>
 some results (like displaying a web page), we have to write it in a way that the computer would understand.<br>
Coding 101 - Think of your code as a translator between English (or whatever language you speak) and Binary.<br>
If you can do this, it will suddenly become much easier to grasp the basics of what is coding.</p><img src="coding.jpg" width="500"><p>
So, think about it this way: your machine only really speaks Binary, but it understands different coding languages.<br>
 In the same way, you only really speak your native language, but you understand the same coding languages<br>
  (if you at least have the basics of some, of course).<br>
The fact that both you and your computer share a common understanding of programming languages means that you can communicate with each other<br>
- just like you did when you clicked to come to this article!</p></h3> </body</html>
